==========================================

* 300 nm Nb feedline
*  30 nm Al KIDs

# Cooldowns:
1. Wire bonds @ room temp
   - center-ground: 864/936 ohm
   - center-center: 1871 ohm
2. Wire Bonds @ 4K
   - center-ground: 0.9 ohm (measured @ 7K)
   - center-center: 1.8 ohm (measured @ 7K)
3. 180820YY180726p1.h5
   - Data taken in 4K dewar, around 7K cold plate. Using B140's HP 8720D VNA
4. Wire Bonds @ 4K
   - center-ground: 0.9 ohm (measured @ 7K)
   - center-center: 1.5 ohm (measured @ 7K)
5. Wire bonds @ room temp
   - center-ground: 877/OL ohm
   - center-center: OL ohm
   - maybe the wirebonds broke during warmup
6. Re-wire-bonded on 180822
7. Wire bonds @ room temp
